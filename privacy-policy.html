        <h1>Privacy Policy for Timer Buddies</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: November 17, 2025</strong></p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Timer Buddies respects your privacy. We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. Everything stays on your device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>Timer Buddies ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your information.</p>
        <p>Timer Buddies was created to help children transition smoothly between activities by providing visual, engaging timers with personalized "buddy" companions. The app is designed with child safety and privacy as top priorities.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Timer Buddies does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.</strong> All data created and used by the app remains exclusively on your device.</p>
        <p>When you use the AI image generation feature, text prompts you enter are sent to third-party AI services solely for the purpose of generating images. These prompts are not stored by Timer Buddies and are processed according to the AI service provider's privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>The app requires certain Android permissions to function properly. Here's what each permission is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> Used to alert you when timers complete or reach milestones. You control whether to grant this permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> Allows timers to continue running accurately even when the app is in the background, ensuring you get timely notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet (INTERNET):</strong> Used to generate AI-powered custom images for your timers when you use the AI image generation feature. Image generation requests are sent to third-party AI services only when you explicitly request them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3.1 Photo Access</h2>
        <p>Timer Buddies uses Android's Photo Picker to allow you to select images for your timers. This system feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lets you choose specific photos without giving the app access to your entire photo library</li>
            <li>Does not require any permission requests</li>
            <li>Ensures the app only sees the images you explicitly select</li>
            <li>Provides enhanced privacy protection built into Android</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All timer configurations, settings, and user preferences are stored locally on your device using Android's secure storage mechanisms. This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Timer names and durations</li>
            <li>Custom timer settings</li>
            <li>App preferences</li>
            <li>References to selected images (the images themselves remain in your gallery)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is never transmitted off your device and is protected by your device's security features.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Timer Buddies uses third-party AI image generation services when you choose to create AI-generated images for your timers. When you use this optional feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your text prompt is sent to the AI service to generate the image</li>
            <li>The generated image is returned and stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>No personal information is sent to these services</li>
            <li>The AI service provider may have their own privacy policies regarding text prompts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Timer Buddies does not use analytics platforms, advertising networks, or tracking tools. We do not collect or monitor your usage of the app.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p><strong>Timer Buddies is designed to be used by or with children.</strong> We take children's privacy extremely seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect any personal information from children or adults</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted except when explicitly using the AI image generation feature</li>
            <li>There is no in-app communication or social features</li>
            <li>No advertisements or third-party tracking</li>
            <li>The app complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) by not collecting any data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parents and guardians maintain full control over all app content and data on their device.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all app data at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstalling the app from your device, or</li>
            <li>Clearing the app's data through your device's Settings → Apps → Timer Buddies → Storage → Clear Data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since Timer Buddies does not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete from our end. You have complete control over all app data through your device.</p>
